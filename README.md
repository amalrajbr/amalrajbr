## Private project - NOCK (NFC Lock System)
I have been working to develop a NFC based authentication system with two step verification.

The main purpose of this project is to develop a seamless user experience in delegating and

withdrawing access to their devices that has been registered with NOCK.

Devices can be a door, vehicle, or anything. 

### SYSTEM DIAGRAM:

Here, the server forms the top entity. The users access the client devices using NFC tags mapped to these devices. As the NFC tags are scanned, the client device will send a request to the server to approve or reject the request.

### DATABASE

The above diagram shows the Database modeling of NOCK System. We have normalized the database to maximum reduce the data repetition and increase the speed of CRUD operations in the system. The database in which this model is implemented for NOCK System is MySQL.
